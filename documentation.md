## Working process

* tried to crawl information from immoscout24 - failed (at least) because of well working bot protection
  * alternatively to crawling locations of flats one could provide the locations manually
  * maybe by passing the source code of the site that is rendered after the manual search?
  * can the dots on the map in hybrid mode help?
* playing around with Jannis' bvg API
* having a look at [fredy](https://github.com/orangecoding/fredy) app to find flats
  * utilizing up to date flat web crawler to get flet locations
  * saving as a list / csv and use in own program
