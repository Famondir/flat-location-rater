# React Frontend for Flask-SocketIO Application

This README provides instructions for setting up and running the React frontend of the Flask-SocketIO application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   cd flask-react-app/frontend

2. Install the required dependencies:

   npm install

### Running the Application

To start the React application in development mode, run:

npm start

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make edits.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

npm run build

This will generate a `build` folder containing the optimized production build of your app.

### Usage

You can create and manage components in the `src/components` directory. The main application logic resides in `src/App.js`.
