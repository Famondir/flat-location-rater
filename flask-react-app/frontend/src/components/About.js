            <h3>Why I changed the topic of my project</h3>
            <p>The ideas for these apps were presented by Jannis at his presentation at BHT Data Scienc class.</p>
            <p>Especially, the idea to get information on how well a location (e. g. for a possible new flat) is connected to points of interests one visits following a regular schedule, was appealing to me.</p>
            <p>This became urgent recently, because I will change my job and finding a closer flat to the future job location, would be nice.</p>
            <p>If this app works well, it will be handy for many more people than my first idea.</p>
        </div>
